# Welcome
Welcome to Bambora's developer documentation. These pages will walk you through setting up your application with client-side and server-side code samples.

# Contributing To The Docs

We've made it easy for anyone to update the documentation. So if you see any docs in error or sections that could use improvement simply look for the `Update Docs` link at the top of every page. It will send you to the GitHub page where you can make the change.
