# Capture payments

When a payment is successfully made using the Native Payment SDK, the payment amount becomes reserved in the customer's bank account. 

In order to then withdraw the payment amount from the customer's bank account, you need to perform a capture operation through our API.

Head to our API docs to see how to **[capture the payment](./server-side.html#capture-payment)**.
