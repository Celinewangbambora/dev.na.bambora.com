# Capture payments

When a payment is successfully made using the **Native Payment** SDK, the payment amount becomes reserved in the customer's bank account. 

In order to then withdraw the payment amount from the customer's bank account, you need to perform a capture operation through our API.

Head to our API docs to see how to **[capture the payment](./api.html#capture-payment)**.
