## Settings
### Activate module
Set to **YES** to allow your customers to use Bambora Checkout as a payment option.

### Merchant number
The merchant number you received from Bambora. You can find your merchant number in the <a href="https://merchant.bambora.com" target="_blank">Bambora Backoffice</a> via the menu **Settings** -> **<a href="https://merchant.bambora.com/merchantnumbers" target="_blank">Merchant numbers</a>**.
<br/>
Merchant numbers starting with a **T** are for testing and numbers starting with a **P** are for live (Production) use.

### Access token
The Access token is the username of an API user. Enter the Access token for your API user, found in the <a href="https://merchant.bambora.com" target="_blank">Bambora Backoffice</a> via the menu **Settings** -> **<a href="https://merchant.bambora.com/apiusers" target="_blank">API users</a>**. If you donâ€™t have an API user, create one and take note of the Access token.

### Secret token
The Secret token is the password of an API user. This token is automatically generated when an API user is created and only displayed once at that time. Therefore you should take note of the Secret token when creating an API user. If you have lost the Secret token you will have to create a new API user in the <a href="https://merchant.bambora.com" target="_blank">Bambora Backoffice</a> via the menu **Settings** -> **<a href="https://merchant.bambora.com/apiusers" target="_blank">API users</a>** -> **Create API user**.

### Window ID
Choose the payment window ID to use. Use this to set up different texts and logos for foreign customers. View your payment windows in the <a href="https://merchant.bambora.com" target="_blank">Bambora Backoffice</a> via the menu **Settings** -> **<a href="https://merchant.bambora.com/paymentwindows" target="_blank">Payment windows</a>**.

### MD5 key
To enhance the security we recommend that you use the MD5 key. Bambora Checkout will work just fine without, but the MD5 key ensures that no one has modified the data sent from Prestashop to Bambora. You can find the MD5 key in the <a href="https://merchant.bambora.com" target="_blank">Bambora Backoffice</a> via the menu **Settings** -> **<a href="https://merchant.bambora.com/merchantnumbers" target="_blank">Merchant numbers</a>** -> **Edit**

### Use instant capture
Enable instant capture to capture the payment immediately. You may only use instant capture if your customers receive their products immediately, like digital goods as e-books and the like.

### Enable immediateredirect
Set to **YES** to redirect your customer to the order confirmation page when the payment is complete.<br>
Set to **NO** to keep displaying the payment window allowing the customer to close it.

### Display window as
Choose how to display the payment window. Either as an **overlay** on top of your website or in **full screen**.
