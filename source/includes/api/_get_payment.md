# Get Payment

**[Click](https://github.com/bambora/dev.bambora.com/blob/master/source/includes/api/_get_payment.md) to edit this section.**

## Request

```python
import requests

PAYMENT_REFERENCE = '<PAYMENT_REFERENCE>'
MERCHANT_ACCOUNT = '<MERCHANT_NUMBER>'
MERCHANT_TOKEN = '<MERCHANT_TOKEN>'
MERCHANT_SECRET = '<MERCHANT_SECRET>'

URL = 'https://api-beta.bambora.com/payments/{payment_reference}/'

response = requests.get(
    URL.format(payment_reference=PAYMENT_REFERENCE),
    auth=('{}@{}'.format(MERCHANT_TOKEN, MERCHANT_NUMBER), MERCHANT_SECRET),
    headers={'API-Version': '1'}
)
```

```shell
PAYMENT_REFERENCE="<PAYMENT_REFERENCE>"
MERCHANT_NUMBER="<MERCHANT_NUMBER>"
MERCHANT_TOKEN="<MERCHANT_TOKEN>"
MERCHANT_SECRET="<MERCHANT_SECRET>"

URL="https://api-beta.bambora.com/payments/${PAYMENT_REFERENCE}/"
AUTHORIZATION="Authorization: Basic "$(echo -n ${MERCHANT_TOKEN}@${MERCHANT_NUMBER}:${MERCHANT_SECRET} | base64)
â€‹
curl \
    --header "${AUTHORIZATION}" \
    --header "API-Version: 1" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    "${URL}"
```


> The Python code example requires that the [requests library for Python](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/) is installed on the computer that is running the code.

Once you have created a payment Authorization you can then get that payment to see its details. You can also run a `GET` after a payment has been captured.

You will need the following data in order to make the request:

  * A merchant number.
  * A merchant token.
  * A merchant secret.
  * A payment reference.

You will get access to the merchant number, a merchant token and a merchant secret after registering with Bambora.

The payment reference refers to the one that you are required set before making a payment. In order to query/get a payment, you need to include its unique reference.

We have created code examples showing how to query a payment - one written in python and the other written in bash using cURL. Please note that each placeholder needs to be replaced with real data.

## Response

```Response
{
  "region": "emea_0",
  "merchant": "string",
  "payment": "string",
  "state": "None",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "amount": 0,
  "comment": "string",
  "captures": [
    {
      "amount": 1000,
      "comment": "10 EUR capture"
    }
  ]
}
```

If you receive an HTTP status code of 200 (OK) you will also find the payment object, in JSON format, in the response body. Any errors or problems will represent themselves as a non-200 status code. You can see those in the [standard error codes](./api.html#errors).
