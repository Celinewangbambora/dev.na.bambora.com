# Authentication

## Client-Side Only Authentication
If you do not have a server, or just want to send payments through to Bambora from your client app, then we have an authentication method to ensure your payments are secure.

## Server-Side Authentication - API Keys
If you are sending payments through your server to Bambora, you will need an API key to authorize your payments.
