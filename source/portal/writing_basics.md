# Dev Portal Editing

There are two main ways you can contribute to the dev portal:

 * Editing via GitHub
 * Edit the source directly on your machine


## Via GitHub

Each page has an edit icon on it that links to its markdown file on GitHub. There you can click on the Pencil icon to edit the file. Once you are done editing, scroll to the bottom of the page and locate the Commit Changes button. 

This will create a pull request that will be reviewed by one of the portal maintainers. If all is good they will merge your pull request and the change will be automatically deployed.

## Locally Via Source
