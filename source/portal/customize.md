## Capabilities

The dev portal provides many different avenues for customization.

You can easily change anything such as:

 - Text content
 - Images/diagrams
 - Create new tutorials
 - Add an API spec
 - Modify the Table of Contents

With a little more work you can:
 
 - Create new layout templates
 - Create a custom Table of Contents
 - Fork and clone the portal

## Toolset

The dev portal uses a tool called Middleman. This is a static site generator that utilizes layout templates and markdown files to render content. It is very flexible and quite popular. Middleman is built on Ruby.

It is worth giving a quick read up on [Middleman](./middleman.html).

## Modify the Site

If you want to modify the site, clone it, refactor it, the first step is to understand the [Architecture](./architecture.html). After that take a look at one of the following topics:

 - [Regional Dev Portals](./regions.html)
 - [Creating Templates](./templates.html)
 - [Data Files](./data_files.html)
 - [ToC](./toc.html)
 - [CSS](./css.html)
