# Custom Checkout

Our solution limits the scope of your PCI compliance by removing the need for you to pass credit card information through your servers.

This JavaScript library securely injects the following card inputs into your page:
* Card Number
* CVV
* Expiry Date

You can customize the look of user input that is then validated and formatted by card brand (Mastercard, Visa, etc.). 

A token based on card data is returned that can then be used to process a payment.
